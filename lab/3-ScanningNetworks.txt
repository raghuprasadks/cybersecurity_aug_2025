Module 3 - Scanning Networks

Lab 1: Perform Host Discovery

The following are examples of host discovery techniques: 
▪ ARP ping scan (Address Resolution Protocol scan)
▪ UDP ping scan (User Datagram Protocol)
▪ ICMP ping scan (ICMP ECHO ping, ICMP timestamp, ping ICMP, and address mask ping) 
ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
▪ TCP ping scan (TCP SYN ping and TCP ACK ping) 
▪ IP protocol ping scan

Task 1: Perform Host Discovery using Nmap

nmap -sn -PR <ip address>
nmap -sn -PR 43.204.121.160

-sn disables port scan
-PR performs ARP ping scan
-PU: performs the UDP ping scan
-PE: performs the ICMP ECHO ping scan.
-PP: performs the ICMP timestamp ping scan

nmap -sn -PE [Target Range of IP Addresses] 
nmap -sn -PE 10.10.1.10-23

nmap -sn -PR 43.204.121.160

nmap -sn -PU 43.204.121.160

nmap -sn -PE 43.204.121.160

nmap -sn -PP 43.204.121.160



Apart from the aforementioned network scanning techniques, you can also use the following scanning techniques to perform a host discovery on a target network. 
▪ ICMP Address Mask Ping Scan: This technique is an alternative for the traditional ICMP ECHO ping scan, which are used to determine whether the target host is live specifically when administrators block the ICMP ECHO pings.
# nmap -sn -PM [target IP address]
▪ TCP SYN Ping Scan: This technique sends empty TCP SYN packets to the target host, ACK response means that the host is active.
# nmap -sn -PS [target IP address]
▪ TCP ACK Ping Scan: This technique sends empty TCP ACK packets to the target host; an RST response means that the host is active.
# nmap -sn -PA [target IP address]
▪ IP Protocol Ping Scan: This technique sends different probe packets of different IP protocols to the target host, any response from any probe indicates that a host is active.
# nmap -sn -PO [target IP address]


nmap -sn -PM 43.204.121.160

nmap -sn -PN 43.204.121.160

nmap -sn -PS 43.204.121.160

nmap -sn -PA 43.204.121.160

nmap -sn -PO 43.204.121.160

download zenmap

Note: -sT: performs the TCP connect/full open scan and -v: enables the verbose output (include all hosts and ports in the output).

Note: -sS: performs the stealth scan/TCP half-open scan and -v: enables the verbose output (include all hosts and ports in the output).

Note: -sX: performs the Xmas scan and -v: enables the verbose output (include all hosts and ports in the output)

nmap -sT -v <ipaddress>

Perform OS discovery
nmap -A www.kaushalya.tech

Note: -A: to perform an aggressive scan. 
Note: The scan takes approximately 10 minutes to complete

nmap -O www.kaushalya.tech
Note: -O: performs the OS discovery.

nmap --script smb-os-discovery.nse www.kaushalya.tech
Note: --script: specifies the customized script and smb-os-discovery.nse: attempts to determine the OS, computer name, domain, workgroup, and current time over the SMB protocol (ports 445 or 139)
